so [[20220317155345]] simulasi udah clear workflownya, tpi setelah surfing the internet, we found laporan2 Bank Indonesia tahun 2019 and it might be a good validation point, that our model is working correctly.

the problem is, using the trayek that Bank Indonesia used, it still generates to many trips (even only counting arcs and not counting the number of trips on each arc, it's still too many).

there are several hypotheses:
- the number of dispatch reported by Bank Indonesia will follow the demand realized, and using the outflow inflow realization we noticed differences towards the estimasi kebutuhan uang (EKU) for the same year. using demand x => dispatch a, it could be that if demand y/demand x ~ dispatch b/dispatch a. this hypothesis is weak, but it will still be included in the analysis. (di rekap remise, kyknya satu pengiriman itu ya satu arc de ga ngitung jumlah container – yg klo di model kita itu jadi trip)
- the next one is regarding the flexibility of storage in real-life system. Bank Indonesia is known to overuse the capacity of their khazanahs, so making the constraint a bit more flexible (by creating penalties) might just help out to make the dispatch closely resembles the real one.
- the last is the ability to use reverse arcs while only aiming for a suboptimal answer. the hypothesis is that in an optimal solution, an arc will only have one direction, not two – it's just a waste (?) idk, but only aiming for suboptimal solutions might let this problem surface. so it is wise to set it as a constraint. to test this, run a small dispatch planning session and check are there any reverse arc used in combination of the original arc.
- a bit related to the point above, we do know that Bank Indonesia only counts the number of dispatch as in outgoing shipments. so maybe limiting the arcs used to only the outgoing arcs can be insightful.
