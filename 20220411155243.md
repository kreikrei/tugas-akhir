results of demand realization comparison to EKU

results of small set of dispatch plan:
so setting the simulation only for 1 period and considering 1 period ahead generates this:
![../../.julia/dev/DispatchOps/out/one_period_test.svg](../../.julia/dev/DispatchOps/out/one_period_test.svg) 

this image shows that what we hypothesized is true:
- there are double arc usage (a and its reverse is used at the same time)
- inflows to big vaults does happen â€“ like to jakarta and to surabaya

we found out that the proses of building the graph (which will be related to [[20220317222833]] model and [[20220317161039]] BAB 4 PEMODELAN SISTEM) IS NOT ROBUST â€“ it doesn't handle duplicates well enough. jdi klo si dataframe trayeknya jelek, ya jadi jelek juga hasilnya. => SOLVE: pastiin dataframe trayek di libs udah di-unique-an dlu
